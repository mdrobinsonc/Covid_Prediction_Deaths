    "## Step 1: Extract\n",
    "\n",
    "The script loads data from six CSV files located in the specified directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`demographics.csv`**: Population data, including gender and age distributions.\n",
    "2. **`epidemiology.csv`**: Daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths.\n",
    "3. **`health.csv`**: Health-related data such as hospital capacity.\n",
    "4. **`hospitalizations.csv`**: Data on Covid-19-related hospitalizations.\n",

    "### 1. Merging Datasets\n",
    "- Merges all datasets into a single macrotable using `location_key` and `date` as keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cleaning Data\n",
    "- **Removing Non-Essential Columns**:\n",
    "  - Columns like `wikidata_id`, `datacommons_id`, and `iso_3166_1_alpha_3` are dropped as they are not relevant to the analysis.\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "  - Columns with more than 60% missing values are dropped.\n",
    "  - Missing values in population-related fields are filled with the column mean.\n",
    "  - `new_confirmed` and `new_deceased` are filled with `0` to indicate no reported cases.\n",
    "  - Columns from the `vaccination` and `hospitilaztion` were dropped as a majority of it were nulls, data only available for the US and not crucial for predicting deaths due to COVID-19 hence, not useful for our analysis.\n",
    "- **Filtering Critical Columns**:\n",
    "  - Rows with missing `date`, `country_code`, or `cumulative_confirmed` are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Aggregation\n",
    "- Groups data by week and `country_name`.\n",
    "- Computes weekly totals for:\n",

    "  - `new_deceased` (deaths)\n",
    "- Calculates cumulative totals:\n",
    "  - `cumulative_confirmed`\n",
    "  - `cumulative_deceased`\n",

    "\n",
    "  ## **Decisions and Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exclusion of Hospitalization and Vaccination Data**:\n",
    "  - These datasets were excluded due to excessive missing values exceeding the 60% threshold and not material for predicting deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filling Missing Values**:\n",
    "  - Population-related columns were filled with the column mean.\n",
    "  - `new_confirmed` and `new_deceased` were set to `0` for null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cumulative Metrics**:\n",
    "  - Cumulative confirmed and deceased cases were calculated to show trends over time.\n",

    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to uncover meaningful insights and patterns in the processed macrotable. The analysis focuses on demographic factors, temporal trends, and relationships between key variables. Additionally, new variables were introduced, such as **Mortality Rate** and **Vulnerability Index**, to enhance the depth of insights and enrich the final regression analysis for COVID-19 death prediction/modelling. The details provided here summarize key findings, with further elaboration available in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "## **Data Quality Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Low Data Quality for Spain and Italy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spain**:\n",
    "  - Spain's data exhibits significant gaps in **confirmed case reporting**, making it challenging to analyze trends accurately.\n",
    "  - Inconsistent weekly records and missing values for confirmed cases hinder the ability to reliably assess the progression of the pandemic in the country.\n",
    "  - These issues particularly impact insights derived from variables like the **confirmed-to-deceased ratio** and the **vulnerability index**, which rely on confirmed case data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Italy**:\n",
    "  - Italy's data quality issues are most prominent in **mortality reporting**, with large gaps and missing values in the dataset.\n",
    "  - Variability in the consistency of reported deaths across weeks reduces the reliability of calculated metrics such as the **mortality rate**.\n",
    "  - This impacts the ability to analyze trends over time and weakens comparisons with other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Germany**:\n",
    "  - Germany only has **reliable data until Q1 2022**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact on Analysis**\n",
    "- The limitations in Spain and Italy's data directly affect:\n",
    "  - **Comparisons Across Countries**: Data inconsistencies reduce the reliability of cross-country insights for confirmed cases (Spain) and mortality trends (Italy).\n",
    "  - **Temporal Analysis**: Missing or incomplete weekly records hinder the ability to identify consistent temporal patterns for these countries.\n",
    "  - **Regression Analysis**: Incomplete data affects the accuracy of predictive models, particularly for Italy's mortality trends and Spain's confirmed case progression.\n",
